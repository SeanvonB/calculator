This web implementation of a standard pocket calculator helped reinforce my understanding of handling user input and maintaining a running device state. It displays and functions equally well on desktop and mobile.

## Features

-   Compose equations in sequence by continuing to input operations
-   Interact with the interface via cursor, touch, or keyboard

## Credits
